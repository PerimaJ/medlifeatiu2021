# Reference
This is a personal project started by the 2019-2020 Director of Technology, Therisa Tran. 
I created this github as a backup for future executive members that will inherit my work. 
I want the next Tech Chair to be comfortable with making changes, implement their creativity, and learn basic web develop once retiring form this position.
I purposely left some areas not completely filled with content to teach the next Tech Chair an opportunity to work with the website.

### About the Website
The website was intially designed for mobile view for the members, since that was the main method our members visited the site. 
There are still some more change that we plan to implement on the website.
We plan to:
  - incorporate fullcalendar.js to make the google calendar api more visually appealing and user friendly
  - add about 6 content boxes on the front page providing stats of our accomplishments as a student-run organization
  - modify some styling and image via CSS and Photoshop
